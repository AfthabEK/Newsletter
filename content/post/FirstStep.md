Often we receive the question "How to get into FOSS?" Here's the answer !!! 

Are you struggling to break free from the closed source maze? Say goodbye to proprietary software and join us on a journey to unlock the boundless potential of FOSS together. 

"Free as in Freedom" - Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is a set of software where the source code is open to the public, and everybody is free to use the code or contribute to the project. Thanks to FOSS, you don't have to pay to use the software or wait until the annoying ads let you skip it.

One of the most popular reasons people prefer FOSS over proprietary software is transparency. With the source code visible to everyone, you could know what the software is doing. Unlike proprietary software, FOSS allows you to view and edit the source code, known as forking.

Secondly, FOSS fosters a culture of sharing and contribution. Anybody can point out bugs in the code, reuse it in their projects or customize the software. This freedom encourages people to contribute more, which makes the software better, secure and speeds up the development process. 

So ready to dive into the world of FOSS? We have got the right list of software to get you started. Read below to find the best alternatives for your go-to software.

You don't need an account for it as it parses the website of the streaming service to fetch the data we require. You can still subscribe to channels you like and this data is locally stored, ensuring a secure and private user experience. Since it is open source, it is monitored by numerous users, assuring its safety against vulnerabilities and malware. Futhermore, as it uses  the GPL-V3 license, you can create your version of the app by modifying the source code and add new functionalities or modifications to suit your needs.
