## Cherrytree: The FOSS way for note-making

![CherryTree](/cherrytree/cherrytree.jpg)

In this digital era, note-making seems like a daunting task, but at the same time, a crucial step in the process of learning. Cherrytree is a free and open-source note-taking application that helps you organize your notes, ideas, and thoughts hierarchically. It is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

## Tree structure and text formatting

Cherrytree allows you to format your text using a variety of formatting options, including bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and subscript/superscript. You can also change the font, size, and color of your text. 

In addition to basic formatting options, Cherrytree also allows you to add bullet points, numbered lists, and checkboxes to your notes. This makes it easy to create to-do lists and checklists within your notes.
 You can resize images and tables within your notes, and you can also format tables using a variety of options, including cell borders and shading. 
You can create notebooks, sub-notebooks, and individual notes within the tree structure. This makes it easy to keep related notes together and to find what youâ€™re looking for quickly. 

You can also drag and drop notes within the tree structure to rearrange them as needed. This allows you to reorganize your notes as your needs change.

## Hyperlinks and Code snippets

Cherrytree allows you to add hyperlinks to your notes. You can link to other notes within Cherrytree, to external websites, or to files on your computer.
Cherrytree supports syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. This allows you to add code snippets to your notes and to have them displayed with proper syntax highlighting.

## Qualitative Features

The password protection in Cherrytree is applied at the document level, meaning that the entire document is encrypted, not individual nodes or sections within the document. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to keep their notes private and secure. Thus your data resides solely on your devices.

 Users can apply rich text formatting to their notes, including options such as bold, italic, underline, font styles, and colors. This enhances the visual appeal of the notes and allows for better organization.
Cherrytree supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages. This feature is beneficial for users who need to include code snippets in their notes, making it a useful tool for programmers, developers, and anyone working with code. The ability to embed images and attach files to notes adds a multimedia dimension to Cherrytree. This is useful for users who want to include visuals or supplementary materials in their notes.
